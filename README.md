## Structure and purpose of this repository

This repository provides **markdown documents** that describe each computational component of the analyses presented in the manuscript.  
Each markdown document contains all code used for the corresponding analysis, along with explanatory text describing the purpose and rationale of the code.

In addition, each markdown document is accompanied by a corresponding folder containing:

- the original script files used for the analysis  
- files generated by the analysis  

The goal of this repository is to document our methodology in sufficient detail to enable other researchers to reproduce the results reported in the manuscript.

However, the code was originally written to rely on directory/file structures and software path configurations that are specific to the systems on which the analyses were performed.  
Therefore, cloning this repository alone does not fully reproduce the original file organization.

In addition, due to file size limitations, we are not able to host all files required for every analysis on GitHub.  
As a result, users will need to modify file paths within the scripts as needed and download additional required files from external sources (described below).
